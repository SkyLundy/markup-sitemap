MarkupSitemap is essentially an upgrade to MarkupSitemapXML by Pete. It adds multi-language support using the built-in LanguageSupportPageNames. Where multi-language pages are available, they are added to the sitemap by means of an alternate link in that page's `<url>`.

**Discussion:** https://processwire.com/talk/topic/17068-markupsitemap/

### Tasklist

- [ ] Do a little more work on multi-language support to avoid content duplication in the case that the default language and the first language have the same content.
